# Prisma Data Migration Library

I am developing a library to address the problem of data migration in Prisma because I believe this is a relevant and important issue. This library is currently under development and not yet functional, but I am working hard to finish it by **January 20, 2025**.

All the code is open-source, and you are welcome to contribute to its development. You can find the repository here:

[GitHub Repository: Softjey/prisma-dm](https://github.com/Softjey/prisma-dm)

Feel free to open issues, provide feedback, or submit pull requests!
